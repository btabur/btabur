- 👋 Hi, I'm @btabur (Balı Tabur). First of all, I am doing my PhD in Mathematics at Uludağ University. However, I have been dealing with software for several years.
- 🔭 First of all, I started to develop projects with java language in the android field. Then I decided to become a frontend developer. Now I am developing projects with html,css, scss, bootstarp,tailwind and react.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning typescript and next.js.
- 💞️ My primary goal in my projects is to write clean and understandable code.
It's a great feeling to see that the rules I learned from math work out somewhere.
Creating new solutions with team brainstorming and new technologies are always exciting.
